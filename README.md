## About The Project

In a time where websites and resources disappear overnight, **Localized & Categorized** provides a solution to preserve, organize, and share your collection of links. It's built on a simple concept: **your data is yours**. Everything is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage, ensuring complete privacy and control.

This tool isn't just for storing links as you would do with your already built in bookmarks in the browser; it's for creating a portable, shareable library. Export your personal categories and themes into a single file, and pass it on to your friends and others.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Categorization:** Organize bookmarks into custom categories with unique names, descriptions, and icons.
- **Drag & Drop Interface:** Reorder categories and move bookmarks between them with a smooth, modern interface powered by SortableJS.
- **Deep Theme Customization:** Tailor the entire UI to your liking with primary and secondary color pickers. Save, load, reorder, and export your favorite themes.
- **Trust Factor System:** Quickly assess the safety of your links. Mark bookmarks as `Trusted`, `Risky`, `Unverified`, or even `GOAT` status.
- **Shareable User Cards:** Create a personalized user card with custom backgrounds, effects, and badges. This card is baked into your exported files, letting others know who created the collection/s or theme/s.
- **Data Management:** Easily import and export single categories, multiple categories, or your entire collection as `.xan` (bookmarks) or `.xanth` (themes) files.
- **Search:** Instantly find any bookmark by its title, URL, or description.
- **Client Side:** No servers, no tracking, no accounts. All data lives and dies in your browser, unless you choose to export it.

## Getting Started

Getting started is as simple as it gets.

1.  **Download the project:** Clone the repository or download the `index.html` file.
2.  **Open the file:** Open the `.html` file directly in your web browser.
3.  That's it! The application is ready to use.
> **Note**
> I'll include a tiny Chrome extension I've written for this project that lets the user set keybinds to quickly access the HTML file based on its directory.
